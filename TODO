TODO:
  ✔ When search query changes (or when state changes back to TYPING/SELECTING), reset placeholder map @done(23-04-06 20:40)
  ✔ If previous query === new query, don't fetch again @done(23-04-06 20:40)
  ✔ Correctly adding the number of results per search to generated queries @done(23-04-06 20:40)
  When query has no incrementable, either:
    ✘ Only show 1 result (both generatedQueries and placeholder) or @cancelled(23-04-13 21:18)
    ✔ Don't show show any at all (input state doesn't change to FINISHED) @done(23-04-06 20:40)
  Set a scroll boundary to prevent over-scrolling:
      ✔ Scroll back to bound when mouseup @done(23-04-06 20:40)
  ✔ Abstract `useEffects` to custom hook(s) or reducer(s) @done(23-04-06 20:41)
  ✘ Look into transitioning into `useContext` @cancelled(23-04-06 20:43)
  ✔ Limit number of searches to min of 2 (no longer necessary) @done(23-04-06 20:41)
  ✔ Placeholder map needs to represent results per search accurately. @done(23-04-06 20:41)
  ✘ Flickery opacity when dragging @cancelled(23-04-06 20:44) (unsure why, could be browser issue) 
  ✘ Consider lifting scrollAnimation controller up to `SearchScreen` @cancelled(23-04-06 20:45)
  ✔ Pull results/queries from localStorage @done(23-04-06 20:45)
  ✔ Abstract app state to reducer @done(23-04-06 20:45)
  ✘ When search query === last query but `generatedQueries` is empty, fetch again @cancelled(23-04-07 01:18)
  ✘ Handle placeholder map inside `SearchScreen.tsx` (instead of `App.tsx`); @cancelled(23-04-06 20:45) (cancelled because it's better to handle error right where data is fetched) 
  ✔ Custom error message for 429. @done(23-04-06 20:45)
  ☐ When fetch is ready and working, replace mock API with real Google API @high
  ✔ Abstract `useEffects` in `App.tsx` to custom hooks @started(23-04-13 21:25) @done(23-04-13 22:04) @lasted(39m46s)
  ✔ Store last active result and options in `localStorage` @started(23-04-11 21:30) @done(23-04-12 18:57) @lasted(21h27m39s)
    To do so, store the index of the result instead of the result element itself
  ✔ Abstract placeholder map into helper function @low @done(23-04-13 21:23)
  ✔ Add `<title>` for result links. @done(23-04-13 21:20)
  ☐ Write a README.md maybe? @med

  
FIXME:
  ✔ Since placeholder is now handled in SearchScreen, it won't be ready immediately after `inputState` is switch to `FINISHED`. This causes `scrollBound` to be set incorrectly. @started(23-04-12 21:19) @done(23-04-13 21:17) @lasted(23h58m27s)
    Possilbe Solution: 
      ✘ Give individual `SearchResult` access to setting `scrollY` and thus, `scrollBound` is calculated in `SearchResult` instead of `SearchScreen` (Possible performance issue) @started(23-04-13 16:54) @cancelled(23-04-13 21:14) @wasted(4h20m7s) (Reason: `SearchResult` becomes to dependant on `SearchScreen`'s state. Also causes perfoamnce issue as each `SearchResult` will have to scroll and animate on its own)
      Solution: 
        ✔ Lift scrollYAnimation back up to SearchScreen. Scroll related animation will now be handled by `SearchScreen`. This implifies a lot of the problems, and also makes animation much smoother. @done(23-04-13 21:17)
  Generated Queries not set properly when retreiving from localStorage:
     Reason: placeholder map is set immediately on load and when options/inputState changes, causing conflict between placeholder map and generated queries
    ✔ ? Think of a better way to set placeholder map @done(23-04-12 17:51)
  ✘ @low Possibly duplicated search params @started(23-04-11 21:51) @cancelled(23-04-11 21:55) @wasted(4m28s) (intended behaviour for mock API)
  ✔ @high Input is empty when load from localStorage @started(23-04-10 21:58) @done(23-04-11 21:25) @lasted(23h27m25s)
  ✔ On load, when grabbing data from local storage, input states are not set properly (unset) @done(23-04-06 20:45)
  ✘ When adding multiple spaces at the end of input, deleting them will cause input to add a <br> @cancelled(23-04-06 21:21) (problem solved itself somehow, probably due to `tempInputValue` being set properly) 
  ✔ When switching from SELECTING to FINISHED and query hasn't changed, `generatedQueries` will be empty. @done(23-04-06 20:46)
  ✔ Placeholder map needs to update right after options change @done(23-04-06 20:46)
  ✔ Changing options without changing query won't change result items. @done(23-04-06 20:46)


@critical ** IMPORTANT **:
When animating, especially with transform animation, round the value to nearest 1 to prevent laggy animation in Firefox
