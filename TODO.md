TODO:

<!-- ✅ 1. When search query changes (or when state changes back to TYPING/SELECTING), reset placeholder map 2. If previous query === new query, don't fetch again -->

<!-- ✅3. Correctly adding the number of results per search to generated queries  -->

<!-- 4. When query has no incrementable, either:

- Only show 1 result (both generatedQueries and placeholder) or -->
<!--✅- Don't show show any at all (input state doesn't change to FINISHED)  -->

5. Set a scroll boundary to prevent over-scrolling

6. Abstract useEffects to custom hook(s) or reducer(s)
7. Look into transitioning into useContext
